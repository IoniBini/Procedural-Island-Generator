Overview:

the name "aqua caves" doesn't represent what the project is very well. Initially I was going to make a caves system but it never happened.
Instead, I made a system of procedural island generation. I didn't change the name because I'm scared it could break the project.

It is capable of generating a terrain in the format of islands with procedural heights using perlin noise, creating a colour map that corresponds to the heights and finally,
place trees and other details randomly across the surface generated. All of these can be controlled by exposed paramaters.

Controls:
WASD and Space to move and jump
Z to zoom
R to reset the level
P to alternate between the manual scene (the first one) and the procedural one (the second)
ESC to quit

All code that I have gotten as inspiration from other places is referenced in comments on the code itself, as well as in this readme

It is worth noting that all the code that you will need to read is inside the scripts folder. Within the scripts folder, there is anotehr folder called "Legacy".
You can disregard that folder if you'd like, because it contains all my broken code that I left behind just for the sake of documentation.
